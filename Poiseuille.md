# Poiseuille's Law

Poiseuille's law describes the volumetric flow rate (\(Q\)) of an incompressible and Newtonian fluid through a long cylindrical pipe with laminar flow. The formula is given by:

\[ Q = \frac{\Delta P \pi r^4}{8 \mu L} \]

where:
- \( Q \) is the volumetric flow rate.
- \(\Delta P\) is the pressure drop across the length of the pipe.
- \( r \) is the radius of the pipe.
- \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.
- \( L \) is the length of the pipe.
